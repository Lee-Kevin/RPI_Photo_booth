# RPI_Photo_booth

## Brief

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. 2048 was originally written in JavaScript and CSS during a weekend, and released on March 9, 2014, as free and open-source software subject to the MIT license. 

In this project, I rewritten the Game in python on Raspberry Pi, and when you win the game, your picture can be listed on the Ranklist as well as the Photo printer can print the photo out.
